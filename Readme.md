this is just a personal edit of mmaulwurff's cool lazy-points mod so that it is more compatible with "Box Party".

this version is meant to be used alongside Box Party. if you are not playing Box Party, i recommend you just use the original version of this mod. :)

see the link below if you wanna learn more about Box Party.
